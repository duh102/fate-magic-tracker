# FATE Magic Tracker
It's a little tracker for measuring magic usage for characters in a slightly modified FATE system

* Characters and magic state are stored in json format
* Characters have two bars, one pre-exhaustion bar (blue) and one exhausting bar (red)
* Using magic in the pre-exhaustion pool does not cause any harmful effects
* Using magic in the exhausting pool has increasingly dire effects, up to death if it is completely filled (or overfilled)
